Highlight `TODO`,`FIXME`(or whatever other annotations,but for now these two) within your code.

Sometimes you will forget to review the TODOs added while coding till publish the code to production.
So I've been long for a extension to highlight them out and let me know there're notes or things not done.

Hope this extension helps you as well.
